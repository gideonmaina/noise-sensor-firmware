# To be updated

# Software for hardware prototypes
Below resources are forked from original [Airrohr Repo](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/sensors.AFRICA-Noise-sensors-software)

## esp8266-arduino

Currently used and maintained version.

## arduino

Code for all sensors used as prototypes.

## airrohr-update-loader

A transitional firmware which will look for a firmware file
stored on SPIFFS to replace itself with for next reboot
or do an endless loop of panic LED blinking if this fails.

This allows to do an Over-the-air (OTA) procedure on setups
that have a 1M/3M split layout (rather the more modern 2M/2M)
for firmwares larger than 512k (up to ~ 740k).
